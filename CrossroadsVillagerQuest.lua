-- This script is used to create a custom event 
-- where players can interact with specific NPCs 
-- (defined by the NPC_IDS list) using a gossip menu. 
-- The event requires players to have a particular item (ITEM_ID) in their inventory. 
-- When the player initiates a gossip interaction with the NPC, 
-- the NPC will say a random battle cry, 
-- equip a random two-handed weapon from the predefined list (mainHandItems), 
-- and move to a random destination chosen from a set of predefined locations (destinations).
